# Pandemia

This is my entry for the 2017 edition of [js13kGames compo](http://js13kgames.com/), a JavaScript coding competition
for HTML5 Game Developers where the file size limit is set to a maximum of 13 kb (13312 bytes) and no external
libraries are allowed.

The theme for 2017 edition is **Lost**. The actual size of my game is **12.99 kb (13309 bytes. Yes, just 3 bytes less
than the limit :P)** and it took me **77 hours 23 min** to complete.

Pandemia is a zombie survival shooter game with Minecraft inspired graphics where you have to come through hordes of
zombies in order to deliver a vaccine to a safe zone and stop the infection, saving the human race. But wait, you are
already infected, so you will start losing your humanity and with it, your senses. So be quick and accomplish your
critical mission before it's too late and you become an undead.

Best experience in Chrome.

Controls: WASD, ZQSD and ARROWS to move. MOUSE to aim and shoot.
